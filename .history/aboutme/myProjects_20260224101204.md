# My Projects

## C# Console App Video Game

This was a project I did for Programming I, and it involved creating a simple, score-based game. You would play as a character with a sword, and your goal is to kill as many enemies while getting hit as few times as possible.

### Code Snippets
```cs
        static void sword(ConsoleKey input)
        {
            // checking how the sword will appear on screen
            if (isSwinging)
            {
                return;
            }

            if (input == ConsoleKey.Z)
            {
                isSwinging = true;
                swingEnds = DateTime.Now.AddMilliseconds(500);

                if (DirectionFacing == "Left")
                {
                    Console.SetCursorPosition(PlayerX - 1, PlayerY);
                    cursorPos = Console.CursorLeft;
                    SwordX = cursorPos;
                    cursorPos = Console.CursorTop;
                    SwordY = cursorPos;
                }

                if (DirectionFacing == "Right")
                {
                    Console.SetCursorPosition(PlayerX + 1, PlayerY);
                    cursorPos = Console.CursorLeft;
                    SwordX = cursorPos;
                    cursorPos = Console.CursorTop;
                    SwordY = cursorPos;
                }

                if (DirectionFacing == "Up")
                {
                    Console.SetCursorPosition(PlayerX, PlayerY - 1);
                    cursorPos = Console.CursorLeft;
                    SwordX = cursorPos;
                    cursorPos = Console.CursorTop;
                    SwordY = cursorPos;
                }

                if (DirectionFacing == "Down")
                {
                    Console.SetCursorPosition(PlayerX, PlayerY + 1);
                    cursorPos = Console.CursorLeft;
                    SwordX = cursorPos;
                    cursorPos = Console.CursorTop;
                    SwordY = cursorPos;
                }
            }
        }

### What I learned

Throughout the creation of this project, I learned how to use parallel arrays, create a game loop, separate multiple tasks into functions, and improved my ability to debug.
